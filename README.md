A macropad with a 4x4 key switch matrix and 5 slide potentiometer used for volume control. I copied the general design of the MisteRdeck stream deck and turned it in to a 4x4 key switch matrix and added space for an extra slide potentiometer .


## Software Requirements: 
- QMK [Firmware](https://msys.qmk.fm/) and [Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases/tag/beta)
- [Midi-Mixer](https://www.midi-mixer.com/)
- Some type of code editor(any will do)

## Hardware/Machine Requirements
No need to have these things personanlly. As long as you have access to them, it's fine.
- 3D printer
- Soldering iron
- Multimeter

- M3 heat set threaded inserts
- M3x10mm Bolt head screws(I used countersunk head screws as thats all i had on hand)

## Electronic Components:
- 1x Arduino Pro Micro
- 16x key switches
- 16x 1N4148 Diodes
- 5x Slide (Linear) Potentiomters (make sure that they are linear and not a logarithmic potentiometer)
- A bunch of wires
